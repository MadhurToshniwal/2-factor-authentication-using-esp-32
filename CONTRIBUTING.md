## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
- ESP32 development board
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2-factor-authentication-using-esp-32.git
cd 2-factor-authentication-using-esp-32

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Frontend setup (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Upload firmware to ESP32 using Arduino IDE
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow standard JavaScript style guide
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle errors properly

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Add PropTypes for component props (when applicable)
- Keep components small and focused

### Arduino C++
- Follow Arduino coding style
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include error handling
- Use `Serial.println()` for debugging output

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable
- Use conventional commit format when possible:
  ```
  feat: add new MQTT authentication
  fix: resolve WiFi connection timeout
  docs: update README with new setup steps
  ```

## üß™ Testing
